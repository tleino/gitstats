  Some of these are published. Rest still require work before publishing.
  Many of these projects are of historic interest only, but some might
  be useful. Most of the projects are published under a non-restrictive
  license allowing commercial use.

  <h3>Znet UUCP network non-profit (1995-1996)</h3>
  <p>
  Founding member, chairman and a software developer of a non-profit organization
  that was running Finland's largest UUCP network for getting data transmitted
  between bulletin board systems in batch runs, and for enabling people to
  have an e-mail address in the age of dial up connections when many people
  couldn't afford to have a real e-mail address.
  </p>
  <p>Among other things, implemented FTP over e-mail, WWW over e-mail and
  similar gatewaying and convenience systems for getting most of batch-run
  e-mail.

  <h3>BBS software developer and operator (1994-1996)</h3>
  <p>
  System operator and software developer contributor for a public non-profit
  Unix-like remote shell a.k.a. "bulletin board system" and its software and
  accessory tools in the age of dial-up Internet for people without real
  Internet connection. The system was unique because it imitated a real
  Unix shell on a non-Unix operating system on a resource constrained low-end
  computer yet provided all the services people were expecting from a
  "bulletin board system" or from a free-access Unix shell, including message
  boards, realtime chat, multiplayer games, files.
  </p>
  <p>
  Contributed changes to most parts of the system and implemented new tools,
  such as a new realtime chat system, new games with shared scoreboards,
  a foreign platform's door-game emulator, a new terminal emulator, a new
  realtime remote viewing facility of user activity.

  <p>Also found and fixed multiple vulnerabilities in software written by
  others, including remote access vulnerabilities.

  <h3>Virus-removal tool (1998)</h3>

  Discovered a computer virus that was not recognized by existing antivirus
  tools and wrote a virus-detection and virus-removal tool for that virus
  type.
